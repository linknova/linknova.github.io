      “Our attitude towards immigration reflects our faith in the American ideal. We have always believed it possible for men and
      women who start at the bottom to rise as far as the talent and energy allow. Neither race nor place of birth should
      affect their chances.”
      <br> - Robert F. Kennedy

          <h3>History </h3>
           <p class='text'>There is a long history of people who have fought for an immigration reform.

          <ul>
           <h4>2006 Immgration protest</h4>
           <p> During this time there were over a million people who went out to march 
             against the proposed act by the government to push for 
             stronger renforcements in the border. 
             It was the biggest march during that time to occur.
             People coming from Nashville, Tennesse to Koreatown-Los Angeles, California marched 
             in their city as a unit to fight for a good cause while still expressing their own 
             individuality.
           </p>
           <br>
           <h4>Modern time</h4>
           <p> As of today people still march to protest against the 
             higher power and the injustice they want to bring to the people.
             In Los Angeles there is a day called May-Day when people are able to 
             go out and march in peace for what they believe in, such as women's rights,
             gun violence, and immigration rights, that will hopefully make this great country 
             called America better for all people of color and class.
